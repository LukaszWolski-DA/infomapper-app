# Ideas

Ideas that came up while building a slice and are not part of its PRD (AD-25). Each one needs a decision before it
is built.

## Settings: keep the typed value on a stale-version conflict (slice 0, step 5b)

Today, when a save is refused because someone else changed the record meanwhile ("Someone changed this meanwhile.
Reload to see the latest version."), the field goes back to the last value this page saved, and the typed value is
lost. Better: keep the user's typed value in the field and show the current server value next to it, so the user can
choose which to keep (or copy parts of theirs) instead of retyping.

## Mapping by drag: from the attribute side too (slice 1b, step 2)

The prototype also starts a mapping drag from an attribute row and drops it on a column row. The slice 1b PRD asks
only for a column dragged onto an attribute or an entity's header, so this is not built. (Auto-scroll near the canvas
edge, mentioned here before, was built in step 2 at Łukasz's request.)

## Feeding sources: drag from the panel onto the canvas (slice 1b, step 5)

In the prototype, a feeding source (or fed entity) in the right panel can also be dragged onto the canvas and lands
where it is dropped. The slice 1b PRD asks for a click (placed beside the card) and “Add the N missing”, so dragging
from the right panel is not built; the left panel's drag onto the canvas works as before.

## “Undo” in more toasts (slice 1b, step 5)

The prototype offers “Undo” in almost every toast after a change (a new mapping, a relationship, cards placed beside
a card). The slice 1b PRD asks for it on destructive actions only (deletes, remove from canvas), so that is what is
built; Ctrl+Z and the top bar's Undo work for every change.
