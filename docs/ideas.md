# Ideas

Ideas that came up while building a slice and are not part of its PRD (AD-25). Each one needs a decision before it
is built.

## Settings: keep the typed value on a stale-version conflict (slice 0, step 5b)

Today, when a save is refused because someone else changed the record meanwhile ("Someone changed this meanwhile.
Reload to see the latest version."), the field goes back to the last value this page saved, and the typed value is
lost. Better: keep the user's typed value in the field and show the current server value next to it, so the user can
choose which to keep (or copy parts of theirs) instead of retyping.

## Mapping by drag: from the attribute side too (slice 1b, step 2)

The prototype also starts a mapping drag from an attribute row and drops it on a column row. The slice 1b PRD asks
only for a column dragged onto an attribute or an entity's header, so this is not built. (Auto-scroll near the canvas
edge, mentioned here before, was built in step 2 at Łukasz's request.)

## Feeding sources: drag from the panel onto the canvas (slice 1b, step 5)

In the prototype, a feeding source (or fed entity) in the right panel can also be dragged onto the canvas and lands
where it is dropped. The slice 1b PRD asks for a click (placed beside the card) and “Add the N missing”, so dragging
from the right panel is not built; the left panel's drag onto the canvas works as before.

## “Undo” in more toasts (slice 1b, step 5)

The prototype offers “Undo” in almost every toast after a change (a new mapping, a relationship, cards placed beside
a card). The slice 1b PRD asks for it on destructive actions only (deletes, remove from canvas), so that is what is
built; Ctrl+Z and the top bar's Undo work for every change.

## Undo and redo on the project and workspace home pages (slice 1b, acceptance)

Undo and redo (the top bar's buttons and Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z) are only on canvas pages (assumption 8 in the slice 1b
acceptance). Changes made on the project and workspace home pages (projects, canvases) are in the undo history too,
but can only be undone from a canvas. Better: the same buttons and keys on those home pages as well.

## Entity tool on a collapsed block (slice 2c, step 4)

The Entity tool creates the new entity exactly where clicked, also on a collapsed frame's block, and the new card does
not join that frame (as in the prototype; Łukasz's decision (i) in step 4). Better: the Entity tool on a collapsed
block files the new entity into the frame like a drop, and takes the concept of a concept frame.

## Labels on requirements (after slice 2c)

Labels on requirements: `label_link` gets a `requirement_id` target (a new migration, with the “exactly one target”
check extended to it), and the requirement panel gets a Labels field. D-33 keeps labels and requirements separate today;
decide with the requirements slice (4).
