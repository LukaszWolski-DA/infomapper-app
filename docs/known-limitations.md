## Local data adapter (AD-29)

### "At least one canvas" can race (slice 0)

Removing a canvas from a project is refused when the canvas would belong to no project, or the project would have no
canvas left (D-28). The command checks this against links read just before the write; the local adapter then
re-checks versions, keys and references inside its serialised write, but not this count. Two removals at the same
moment can therefore both pass the check and leave a canvas or project without its last link.

- **Accepted** in the local adapter: it is development only and has one user at a time in practice.
- **Supabase slice:** check this rule in the same transaction as the write (e.g. lock the project's and the canvas's
  `project_canvas` rows, count, then delete), so concurrent removals cannot both succeed.
